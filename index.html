		<p>Hello, my name is Amy. I am a <span id="age"></span> year old girl from Wales. 
		<span style="float: right;"><img src="../Assets/Images/IMG_20180717_102024.jpg" style="width: 200px"/></span>
		I've been interested in computers and technology from a very young age, with my first PC being an old, very beige Windows 95 machine which I used to play games and mess around with paint. I was also very interested in video games from about the same age with my first console being the PS2. Towards my teens I got interested in programming and made a small CYOA game that was written in batch, for most of my teen years I practiced programming on and off and didn't really begin to seriously make things until winter 2017 when I made a Discord bot to play truth or dare that was written in C#. I became interested in graphic design after leaving comprehensive.</p>

		<h3>Computers</h3>
	
		<p>As mentioned above I became interested in computers from a very young age. I also took BTEC ICT in year 10 and 11, however it was a really disappointing subject as we were more taught about the Microsoft Office suite than we were about how computers work and are built. I later took a level 1 NVQ in IT User and took on the role of IT tech for the company I was working for as part of my NVQ  where I spent most of my days maintaining and repairing computers and laptops.</p>
		
		<h3>Programming</h3>
		
		<p>I have been programming on and off for the last 5 years and only recently started building worthwile projects in winter 2017 when I built a truth or dare bot for Discord in C#. since then i have started other projects including a couple of small Unity games and a Twitch chat and moderation bot. In the future I plan to learn to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.JS) framework in order to create web apps as well as completing the <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science">Harvard CS50</a> online course to round out my knowlege of computer science.</p>
		
		<h3>Gaming</h3>
		
		<p>I've been playing games since I was about 5 with one of my first games being Mechwarrior 3. As I reached my teens I became interested in not only playing games but figuring out how they worked, the underlying logic and calculations, and then figuring out how to break them. This eventually lead to me learning how to use Unity and create small games. More resently I began taking an interest in taking screenshots in games using typical photography techniques such as the rule of thirds and framing.</p>
		
		<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
		
		<p>I became interested in graphic design during my last job where I was often asked to create marketing, promotional and display materials. Following that I continued to create small pieces based on online tasks as well as createing things for my personal use and for friends and family.</p>
